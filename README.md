# E-Commerce Product List Application

### Say hello to the future.

This is a simple and efficient e-commerce product list application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux Toolkit**. The application enables users to browse products, search by keyword, and manage their shopping cart with state persistence. It incorporates infinite scrolling for a seamless user experience and is fully responsive to adapt to various screen sizes.

## Project Overview

The application showcases a product listing page where users can:
- View a catalog of products fetched from a mock API.
- Load more products dynamically as they scroll (infinite scrolling).
- Search for specific products using a search bar.
- Add products to a shopping cart with a summary showing total items and price.
- Persist cart data across page reloads, ensuring that items remain in the cart until manually removed.

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building user interfaces with functional components and hooks.
- **TypeScript**: For ensuring type safety throughout the codebase.
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage global state and facilitate the cart functionality.
- **RTK Query**: For fetching and caching API data.
- **Redux Persist**: To store the cart data in localStorage for persistence.
- **React Infinite Scroll Component**: To handle the infinite scrolling feature.
- **React Loader Spinner**, **React Loading Skeleton**: For visually appealing loading states.
- **SweetAlert2**: To provide smooth and intuitive user alerts.

## Key Architectural Choices
- **Component-based design**: The UI is broken down into small, reusable components, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
- **State management with Redux Toolkit**: Redux Toolkit is used to handle the applicationâ€™s state efficiently, particularly for managing cart items and API calls.
- **RTK Query for API interactions**: The application leverages RTK Query for easy and optimized fetching of product data from the mock API.
- **Cart persistence with Redux Persist**: Cart data is stored in localStorage, allowing users to maintain their cart state even after refreshing the page.
- **Mobile-first, responsive design**: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it works well on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Type safety with TypeScript**: TypeScript is used throughout the project to enforce robust type-checking and reduce runtime errors.
